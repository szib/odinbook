## Conclusion

It was a loooong project, I needed lot more time to finish it as I had thought. Six weeks... OMG. To be honest it has not been finished at all yet. There are many things to do, but I believe it's better to leave it as it is for now and focus on other projects. I learned a lot building this app, I feel more confident using Rails, Bootstrap, rspec, etc.
